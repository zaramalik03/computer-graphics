For this project, it is a 3D city-like architectural scene of buildings set in the day time. 
The scene includes primarily buildings of all different sizes, a road, a shining sun, small plants 
you can see through the doors, and the surprise.

The surprise is a magnificent rainbow placed behind the shadows of allthe buildings. You may need to 
rotate the camera around in order to locate and reveal it. The rainbow overall uses multicolored half circles to make it
visually appealing when found.
